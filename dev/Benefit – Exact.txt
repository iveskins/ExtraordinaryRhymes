Test lyrics.

Making emcees freeze, and drop to their knees, like getting caught smuggling keys to Caribbean seas /
At ease, I puff trees ‘till I look Chinese, and immigration says: can we see your Green Card please? /
My rhymes never ricochet, needless to say, I'm just like the word KILL, only minus the K /
If you hear my track play, close your eyes and pray, I'm just like the word BASIC, only minus BA /

Top of the food chain, rub your brain with coarse grain, sandpaper dipped in glue and glass, so there's more pain /
I haven't reached my whole goal, ‘till I've got your whole soul, over beats so hot, that they stop, drop, and roll /
Extravagant, far from arrogant, it's just apparent that I'm better than any emcee, and I'm declaring it /
I'm giving stitches, to phony b!tches acting vicious, chefs around the world claim my flavor's delicious /

When it's talent they lack, then it's beat they rob, I shined so bright, the sun had to quit its day job /
It takes dedication, to rip the ill iteration, quite amazing, blazing hotter than Cajun incineration /
Crime emcees, pretending to be, deadly and steady with the gun, in reality they're ready to run /
Before you learn to run, to have to learn to walk, I'll help the cops out and write my rhymes around you in chalk /

I got the deaf people hearing this, blind people seeing this, paralyzed from the neck down, still feeling this /
I got the deaf people hearing this, blind people seeing this, paralyzed from the neck down, still feeling this /
