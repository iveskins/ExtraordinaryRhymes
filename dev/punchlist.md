* Use Wikitionary API for more nuanced rhymes. For example, the rhyme for heal (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/heal) is -i:l (meaning "eel"), rhyme for field (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/field) is -i:ld (meaning "eeld"). The words are not presented as rhymes of each other since field has the 'd' sound at the end. But the rhyme is extremely near, we could consider it a near rhyme by decomposing each word into its IPA or rhymes notation and then checking for a partial match, i.e. -i:l vs. -i:ld. The only problem is when we run into words like this: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/prioritize. We'd have to decompose the word into syllables and then do a syllable on vowel match or whatever. Pri-yor-rih-ti-zuh. My bored quick ties. So perhaps the key is to decompose word into syllable rhymes and then rhyme each syllable (on each vowel).
