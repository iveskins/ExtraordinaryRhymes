* Use Wikitionary API for more nuanced rhymes. For example, the rhyme for heal (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/heal) is -i:l (meaning "eel"), rhyme for field (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/field) is -i:ld (meaning "eeld"). The words are not presented as rhymes of each other since field has the 'd' sound at the end. But the rhyme is extremely near, we could consider it a near rhyme by decomposing each word into its IPA or rhymes notation and then checking for a partial match, i.e. -i:l vs. -i:ld. The only problem is when we run into words like this: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/prioritize. We'd have to decompose the word into syllables and then do a syllable on vowel match or whatever. Pri-yor-rih-ti-zuh. My bored quick ties. So perhaps the key is to decompose word into syllable rhymes and then rhyme each syllable (on each vowel).
* Can't discern the user's intention. What about checking for rhymes only at the end of the line (both multisyllabic and whatever), this makes it easier. Most rhymes rhyme at the end. For multisyllabic rhymes we could deconstruct into the IPA (Wikitionary), end rhyme should be pretty simple with the API. But the question is: what about internal rhyme? (cf. Rakim.) It appears that rhyme schemes will be simpler with only end rhymes (either masculine or feminine, or multisyllabic (in a way that transcends words, cf. A Tribe Called Quest and Rakim)).
* Examples: my unusual style, will confuse a while, if I was water, I'd flow in the Nile.
* Back, and forth, just like a Cameo song, if you dig this joint then come dance along.
