Wanna get low
Wanna get high
Glue's in the bag like clouds in the sky
Sticks to the side and sticks to your lips

Wanna get the spiders off my hips
Try and make out when you don't get kissed, you wanna get it up but she broke your wrist
Dad's got your arms and your mother's got your fists
Crossing off the kids off the Christmas list

The F-Word's here and the F-Word's bad
I cussed my mother and I cussed my dad
But I love my mother and I love my dad
I wanna have all that they never had
